# Arduino CLI Usage Skill

Purpose: Provide cross-platform arduino-cli commands and guidance for serial port detection, library and board discovery, compilation, and upload workflows.

Contents:
- `references/` — detailed command references and OS-specific serial detection
- `examples/` — runnable example workflows (command sequences)
- `rules/` — best practices and common pitfalls

Quick start:

- Use `arduino-cli` with `--format json` for machine-readable output when scripting.
- Prefer platform-specific serial detection commands before attempting uploads.

See `references/commands.md` and `references/serial-ports.md` for detailed examples.
