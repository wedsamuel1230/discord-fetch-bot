## Resources

This skill includes bundled tools:

- **scripts/generate_readme.py** - Full README generator with wiring diagrams and templates

## Quick Start

**Interactive mode:**
```bash
uv run --no-project scripts/generate_readme.py --interactive
```

**Quick generation:**
```bash
uv run --no-project scripts/generate_readme.py --project "Weather Station" --board "ESP32" --output README.md
```

**Scan existing project:**
```bash
uv run --no-project scripts/generate_readme.py --scan /path/to/arduino/project --output README.md
```

## When to Use
- "Help me document this project"

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Arduino IDE

1. **Install Arduino IDE**
   - Download from [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
   
2. **Add Board Support** (if using ESP32/RP2040)
   ```
   File → Preferences → Additional Board Manager URLs:
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
   ```
   Then: Tools → Board → Boards Manager → Search "[board]" → Install

3. **Install Required Libraries**
   - Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries
   - Search and install each library from the table above

4. **Clone or Download This Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repo-name].git
   ```
   Or download ZIP and extract

5. **Open the Project**
   - Open `[project-name].ino` in Arduino IDE

### Option 2: PlatformIO (Recommended for Advanced Users)

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [PlatformIO extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)

2. Clone and open:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repo-name].git
   cd [repo-name]
   code .
   ```

3. PlatformIO will automatically install dependencies from `platformio.ini`

## ⚙️ Configuration

Before uploading, customize `config.h`:

```cpp
// === NETWORK SETTINGS ===
#define WIFI_SSID     "your-wifi-name"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "your-wifi-password"

// === HARDWARE PINS ===
#define LED_PIN       4
#define SENSOR_SDA    21
#define SENSOR_SCL    22

// === FEATURE FLAGS ===
#define ENABLE_OLED   true
#define ENABLE_WIFI   true
#define DEBUG_MODE    true
```

### Environment-Specific Settings

3. **[Normal Operation]** - Description of what happens

### LED Status Indicators

| LED State | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Solid Green | Normal operation |
| Blinking Blue | WiFi connecting |
| Red Flash | Error (check serial) |

### Serial Monitor

Open Serial Monitor at 115200 baud to see:
```
[BOOT] Project Name v1.0.0
[INFO] Initializing sensors...
[OK] BME280 found at 0x76
[INFO] Connecting to WiFi...
[OK] Connected: 192.168.1.100
[DATA] Temp: 23.5°C, Humidity: 45%
```

### Web Interface (if applicable)

Navigate to `http://[device-ip]` to access:
- Real-time sensor readings
- Configuration panel
- Data export

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<details>
<summary><b>Upload fails: "Failed to connect"</b></summary>

**ESP32:** Hold BOOT button while clicking Upload, release when "Connecting..." appears.

**Arduino:** Check correct COM port selected in Tools → Port.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Sensor not detected</b></summary>

1. Check wiring (SDA/SCL not swapped?)
2. Run I2C scanner sketch to verify address
3. Add pull-up resistors (4.7kΩ) if not on module
4. Check voltage compatibility (3.3V vs 5V)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>WiFi won't connect</b></summary>

1. Verify SSID/password in config.h (case-sensitive!)
2. 2.4GHz only (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
3. Check router isn't blocking new devices
4. Try moving closer to router
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Random resets</b></summary>

1. Power supply too weak - use 500mA+ source
2. Add 100µF capacitor near MCU
3. Check for short circuits
4. Disable brownout detector (ESP32)
</details>

### Still Stuck?

1. Check [Issues](https://github.com/[username]/[repo]/issues) for similar problems
2. Open a new issue with:
   - Hardware setup (board, sensors)
   - Error messages (full serial output)
   - Steps to reproduce
