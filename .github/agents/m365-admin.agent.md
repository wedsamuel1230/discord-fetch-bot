## Subagent & Memory Bank Discipline

For complex or multi-domain tasks, use #runSubagent to delegate to complementary agents. Ensure memory-bank/ exists before work; read files in order: projectbrief.md → activeContext.md → SESSION.md → README.md. Log sessions in SESSION.md using YYYY-MM-DD — vX.Y.Z. Load relevant skills before specialized work.
